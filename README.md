# ConvNext-for-dog-breed

## The project's goal
The objective of this Notebook is to detail the implementation of a new algorithm for detecting the breed of the dog on a photo, in order to speed up the indexing work in a database.

During the previous project, I used CNN (Convolutional Neural Netwok) algorithms using transfer learning. I obtained satisfactory results, but the objective is to further improve the results.

After the introduction of transformers in NLP, they were used for image processing, and because of its success the CNN models became almost obsolete, for rebirth again, The facebook research center published an article that they called Convnet for 20s, whose goal is to take the benefits of the techniques used in transformers and implement them in ConvNext using ResNet. The idea is interesting in the sense that we have two branches for image modeling and classification.

the ConvNext algorithm is implemented in tansorflow, the version 1 was first released in March 2022, and the version 2 was released in January 2023.
